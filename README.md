Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains the R script for merging and processing the files used for the course project on Getting and Cleaning Data.

The data required for this project is on:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## As mentioned on the Course Project requirements, run_analysis.R script does the following:
### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Kindly note that the script contains enough comments explaining the actual implementation of aforementioned requirements.

I wrote the script to the best of my ability acquired during this study even though I do not have much time to study every topic on this course. Anyway, I am having fun doing this course.

## Thanks for evaluating my work !!!
